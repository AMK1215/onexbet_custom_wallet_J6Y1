echo "- Webhook Controllers: Using OLD balance values in responses\n";

echo "1. WithdrawController: Added \$userWithWallet->refresh() after withdraw\n";
echo "2. DepositController: Added \$userWithWallet->refresh() after deposit\n";

echo "WithdrawController should now show:\n";
echo "- before_balance: 50000, balance: 49990 (after -10 withdraw) âœ…\n";

echo "1. Run your API tests again\n";
echo "2. Check the logs for correct balance values\n";
