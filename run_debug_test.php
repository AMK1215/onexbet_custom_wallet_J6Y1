echo "- Balance calculations: Mathematically correct\n";
echo "- Issue: Missing transaction processing logs in Deposit/Withdraw\n";
echo "- Likely cause: Gaming provider expects different balance format\n\n";

echo "üìã NEXT STEPS:\n";
echo "1. Run your API tests again\n";
echo "2. Check storage/logs/laravel.log for complete transaction flow\n";
echo "3. Look for 'processTransactions completed' and 'Final API response' logs\n";
echo "4. Compare our response format with working site expectations\n\n";

echo "üéØ EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:\n";
echo "Look for these new log entries:\n";
echo "- 'DepositController: Starting processTransactions'\n";
echo "- 'DepositController: processTransactions completed'\n";
echo "- 'WithdrawController: Starting processWithdrawTransactions'\n";
echo "- 'WithdrawController: processWithdrawTransactions completed'\n";
echo "- 'Final API response' with complete response data\n\n";

echo "A) Our API response format\n";
echo "B) Gaming provider validation logic\n";
echo "C) Balance synchronization between systems\n\n";
